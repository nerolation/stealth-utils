        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Stealth addresses are a way of protecting the privacy of recipients in cryptocurrency transactions. They allow a sender to non-interactively generate a new address for the recipient, making it look like as if the sender interacted with some random account.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of stealth addresses and how they work. We'll also create interactive examples that demonstrate their use. The following is based on EIP-5564 which defines a stealth address standardization that can help stealth addresses to gain broad usage.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="example1">
        <h2>How to receive stealth transactions?</h2>
        <div>
        <p>In order to signal your ability to receive stealth transactions, you need a <span style="font-weight: bold;">stealth meta-address</span>. <br>The stealth meta-address consitsts of <span style="font-weight: bold;">two different public keys</span> (that can be compressed to 33 bytes each),
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">spending</span> and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">viewing public key</span>,
        which are used by senders to send funds to the stealth address of the respective user.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The stealth meta-address can be publicly shared and used by others to generate stealth addresses on behalf of the owner.</li>
        <li>The stealth meta-address does not reveal any information about future stealth addresses that are generated on behalf of the owner.</li>
        <li>The corresponding private keys must be kept private. Only the viewing key can be shared with trusted third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The viewing key secures your privacy while the spending key secures access to funds.<br></span></p>
        </div>
        <p>Let's generate an example stealth meta-address</p>
        <form id="input-form-1">
          <input style="width:70%;max-width:900px;" type="text" id="stealthmetaoutput">
          <button type="submit">Generate</button>
        </form>
        <p>Essentially, the stealth meta-address is just the same as 2 standard Ethereum addresses combined.<br>
          The prefix `st:eth:` tells us that this is a stealth meta-address used on the Ethereum mainnet (see <a href=https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3770>EIP-3770</a>).</p>
        <p id="pstealthmetaaddressinfo" style="display:none;">And these are the spending and viewing private keys, that map to the public keys encoded in the stealth meta-address:</p>
        <textarea id="stealthmetaaddressinfo" rows="4" style="width:70%;max-width:900px;display:none"></textarea>
        <p id="pstealthmetaaddressinfo2" style="display:none;">The private keys must be kept secret because they are used to find and access one's own stealth addresses.<br>As you can see, the spending and viewing public key are both part of the stealth meta-address.</p>

        <h2>How to send to a stealth meta-address?</h2>
        <div>
        <p>In order to send fund to someone's stealth address you need the recipient's <span style="font-weight: bold;">stealth meta-address</span>.
        Using the stealth meta-address of the recipient, one can derive the information necessary to perform the stealth transaction. </p>
        <p>Let's go trough a quick example of how the final stealth address is derived. <br>
          We have Alice, who wants to send funds to the stealth address of Bob.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Alice take the stealth meta-address of Bob and inputs it into some EIP-5564 compatible interface.</li>
        <li>The interface takes the stealth meta-address, generates a random number and, after some ellipic curve operations, returns the stealth address of the recipient together with a `Announcement`.</li>
        <li>Alice can then send funds to the derived stealth address and publish the additional information retrieved. After that, she can be sure that Bob has every required information to find the stealth address and access it.
          All of this can be done in the background, hidden from the user, giving the user the feeling of sending to a stealth meta-address using a single transaction.</li>
        <li>The announcement is published so that Bob can use it to find the stealth address Alice sent to and then derive the private key that controlls that address. </li>
        <li>The View Tag will allow Bob to speed up the parsing process to find his stealth address.
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You can try it out here. Input a stealth meta-address and get all the info necessary to then execute a transaction.</p>
        <form id="input-form-2">
          <input style="width:70%;max-width:900px;" placeholder="st:eth:0x..." type="text" id="stealthaddress">
          <button type="submit">Get Info</button>
        </form>
        <textarea id="stealthaddressinfo" rows="3" style="width:70%;max-width:900px;display:none"></textarea>
        <p>Head over to Etherscan and use the contract on <a  target="_blank" href=https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x801dE179a92968C84C3dd716568fDCA7D4ab2552#writeContract>this</a> address to send ETH and publish the announcement. The view tag can be ignored for now.<br>
          The contract simply emits an Announcement event, every time the `announce` function is executed. </p>
          <p>⚠️ Only try it on the Sepolia testnet ⚠️</p>

        <h2>How do I know that someone sent to a stealth address that I can access?</h2>
        <div>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Parsing.</span> You have to go trough all announcements and check if the respecitive announcement,
          applied to your viewing private key, can unlock a valid stealth address.<br>

      While the <span style="font-weight: bold;">viewing private key</span> is used to find your stealth address,
      the <span style="font-weight: bold;">spending private key</span> is used to access those funds.<br>
      Therefore, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">viewing private key</span> can be given to a trusted parsing-provider that takes over the pasing job.<br>
          Finally, if successfully, the parsing provider returns the announcement that can then be used, together with the spending private key, to access the stealth address.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You can try it out here. Input your spending public key and your viewing private key and let the service start parsing.</p>

          <p id="psecretinfo" style="display:none;">The stealth secret can then be used to derive the private key that can access the funds on the stealth address <br>Essentially, all the recipient has to to is a simple addition: The recipient takes the spending private key and adds it to the stealth secret. <br>You can use the below field to derive the final stealth private key:</p>


          <form style="display:none;" id="input-form-4">

            <textarea id="secretinfo2" rows="3" style="width:70%;max-width:900px;display:none;"></textarea>
            <p id="psecretinfo2" style="display:none;">The stealth private key can then be imported and used to access the funds on the stealth address.</p>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <div class="faq-section">
  <dl>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <dt>What is a stealth address?</dt>
      <dd>Stealth addresses are regular Ethereum addresses that are generated by the sender in a non-interactive manner, with the knowledge that only the intended recipient will be able to access it. This approach allows the sender to avoid direct interaction with a specific entity, such as xyz.eth, and instead communicate through a fresh account that is not linked to the respective entity.</dd>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <dt>What's the benefit of using stealth addresses?</dt>
      <dd>The use of stealth addresses enables the recipient of a transaction to remain anonymous, thereby preventing any on-chain links between the identity of the sender and the recipient. By utilizing stealth addresses, senders can send funds to recipients without revealing the fact that such a transaction has taken place to anyone else.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <dt>What is meant by "non-interactively"?</dt>
      <dd>Stealth addresses do not require recipients to set up fresh new addresses for all potential senders. Instead, users must only generate a personal stealth meta-address once, which can then be used by other users to derive stealth addresses from it. Of course, nothing prevents users from just exchanging fresh addresses for every interaction manually, though, stealth addresses make such scenarios much more user-friendly.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <dt>What are some potential use cases for stealth addresses?</dt>
      <dd>Stealth addresses offer significant potential for use in political donations, where senders may wish to avoid creating an on-chain connection to the recipient. For instance, by employing stealth addresses, one can contribute to an organization while enabling the organization to remain anonymous. To external observers, stealth transactions appear identical to regular transactions to a new address. An equivalent level of privacy can be achieved if senders use an encrypted channel to reach out to recipients and request newly generated addresses. However, this approach would necessitate the recipient to be active for every potential sender.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <dt>What is a stealth meta-address?</dt>
      <dd>The stealth meta-address is a publicly shareable address that users can use to signal their willingness to engage in stealth address transactions. Senders use the stealth meta-address to derive distinct stealth addresses for their recipients. Wallet applications may provide UIs that allow users to simply input the stealth meta-address of another user and send directly to the (on-the-fly) generated stealth address, while emitting the necessary announcement.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <dt>Why is the stealth meta-address so long?</dt>
      <dd>Stealth meta-addresses consist of two (different) public keys, the spending and the viewing public key. Both public keys can be compressed to 33 bytes, so the stealth meta-address has a length of 66 bytes. Notably, EIP-5564 is agnostic to different cryptographic schemes and allows users to generate stealth meta-addresses with an arbitrarily length (eg. lattice-based crypto).</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <dt>Why do I need a spending and a viewing key for a stealth address?</dt>
      <dd>While the viewing private key allows users to locate/find stealth addresses, the spending private key is used to derive the stealth private key that can eventually access the funds on the stealth address. Therefore, the viewing private key can be shared with trusted parsing providers who may assist in finding active stealth addresses that belong to oneself. The spending private key, on the other hand, must be kept private at all times.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <dt>What is EIP-5564 and EIP-6538?</dt>
      <dd>In essence, the EIP-5564 standard serves to standardize the Messenger contract, which is necessary to trigger the event that provides recipients with the information needed to locate their stealth addresses (through parsing). While EIP-5564 establishes the basic framework for stealth addresses, it also enables the implementation of specific stealth address methods that use cryptographic schemes, such as secp256k1, to build upon this foundation and take advantage of the standardized Messenger contract. EIP-6538 represents the initial implementation of a stealth address scheme based on secp-256k1.</dd>
